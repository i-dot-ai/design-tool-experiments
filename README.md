A place for the i.AI team to host experiments in vibe coding simple design tools.

## The tools
- [Dots](https://i-dot-ai.github.io/design-tool-experiments/dots) 
- [Ethereal blobs](https://i-dot-ai.github.io/design-tool-experiments/etherealblobs)
- [Kinetic flow](https://i-dot-ai.github.io/design-tool-experiments/kineticflow)
- [Vector hills](https://i-dot-ai.github.io/design-tool-experiments/vectorhills)
- [3D plane animation studio](https://i-dot-ai.github.io/design-tool-experiments/3dplanestudio)
- [Monolith clusters](https://i-dot-ai.github.io/design-tool-experiments/monolithclusters)

## The code
[The code for the tools is available on Github](https://github.com/i-dot-ai/design-tool-experiments)

## The hypothesis
The hypothesis here is that it's more interesting to use AI to generate design _tools_ than it is to directly generate design _outputs_.
By creating custom design tools we invite ourselves back in to the creative process and break the ongoing dependency on AI.
Creative outputs become repeatable, editable and legible - we can see how they are made.
